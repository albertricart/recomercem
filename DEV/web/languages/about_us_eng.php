Due to the COVID crisis, many businesses have had to close, and those that still remain are finding it difficult to gain customers. Online businesses are on the rise, while small businesses are on the decline. Thanks to Recomerçem, we can publicize all these businesses. An addition is that businesses can add their offers, this helps people who have also suffered from this crisis, to buy better products also helping the business.';

$abourMarioText = 'About: <b>Mario De La Torre</b>, 22 years old, born in Barcelona, ​​Spain. I have always liked computer science in general, since I discovered programming I was quite clear that I would like to be able to dedicate myself to it. One of my goals is to be able to end up working as a frontend developer and dedicate myself to the visual part of the projects. I started with a Middle Degree in computer science, which continued with 1 year of video game development and a Higher Degree in Multiplatform Applications Development. I have taken several courses in graphic design and have worked on 2 other projects prior to this one. Do you want to know me better? Visit my website: ';
